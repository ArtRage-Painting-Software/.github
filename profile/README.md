## What is ArtRage?

**ArtRage** is a powerful digital painting software designed to simulate traditional art materials with stunning realism. Unlike standard digital art programs that focus on synthetic brushes, ArtRage recreates the actual behavior of oil paints, watercolors, pencils, and other natural media through advanced physics-based algorithms.

With ArtRage, artists can experience:
- True-to-life oil painting with realistic blending and texture.
- Authentic watercolor effects with wet diffusion and paper absorption.
- Natural pencil and chalk tools that respond to pressure and tilt.
- Intuitive interface that mimics real art studios.

The software is used by professional illustrators, concept artists, and hobbyists worldwide for creating digital artwork that looks traditionally made. From thick impasto oil strokes to delicate watercolor washes, ArtRage provides the most authentic traditional painting experience available digitally.

Its affordable pricing and regular updates make ArtRage accessible to artists at all skill levels. Whether you're transitioning from physical to digital media or seeking more natural painting tools, ArtRage delivers unparalleled realism and creative freedom.
